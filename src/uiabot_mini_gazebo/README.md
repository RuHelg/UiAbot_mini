# uiabot_mini_gazebo

Brief README for launching the `uiabot_mini_gazebo` simulation, SLAM and navigation stacks.

**Overview**
- **Package:** `uiabot_mini_gazebo`
- **Launch file:** `launch/uiabot_mini_gazebo_launch.py` (entry: `uiabot_mini_gazebo_launch.py`)
- This README explains how to build and run the gazebo simulation with optional SLAM, Nav2 and RViz.

**Requirements**
- ROS 2 (the distro used in this workspace). Make sure your environment is set up and `colcon` is installed.

**Build**
1. From the workspace root:

```bash
cd /home/stiank/ros2_ws
colcon build --packages-select uiabot_mini_gazebo
source install/setup.bash
```

**Launch arguments**
- `run_slam:=true|false` — start the SLAM node (true to run slam, false to skip). Default: user-defined in launch (set explicitly when launching to be safe).
- `run_nav2:=true|false` — start the navigation (`nav2`) stack (true to run nav2, false to skip).
- `rviz:=true|false` — start RViz for visualization (true to open RViz, false to skip).

Note: Passing these as launch arguments controls what is started together with the Gazebo simulation. Use `true` or `false` (lowercase) when invoking `ros2 launch`.

**Examples**

- Run gazebo + SLAM + Nav2 + RViz:

```bash
cd /home/stiank/ros2_ws
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch uiabot_mini_gazebo uiabot_mini_gazebo_launch.py run_slam:=true run_nav2:=true rviz:=true
```

- Run gazebo only (no SLAM, no Nav2, no RViz):

```bash
cd /home/stiank/ros2_ws
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch uiabot_mini_gazebo uiabot_mini_gazebo_launch.py run_slam:=false run_nav2:=false rviz:=false
```

- Run gazebo + SLAM only (no Nav2, no RViz):

```bash
cd /home/stiank/ros2_ws
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch uiabot_mini_gazebo uiabot_mini_gazebo_launch.py run_slam:=true run_nav2:=false rviz:=false
```

**Troubleshooting**
- If the launch fails, check the launch file path and that the package is built and sourced (`source install/setup.bash`).
- If Gazebo models or plugins are missing, ensure `GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH` includes package model folders or that resources are installed.
- **If Gazebo can't find mesh files** (error: `Unable to find file with URI [model://uiabot_mini_description/meshes/...]`):
  - The launch file automatically sets `GZ_SIM_RESOURCE_PATH` to include the install space.
  - If you still see errors, verify that `uiabot_mini_description` is built and installed (`colcon build --packages-select uiabot_mini_description`).
  - The resource path is set dynamically in the launch file, so it works on any computer after sourcing the workspace.
- If SLAM or Nav2 fail to start check their individual logs and ensure required packages are installed in your ROS 2 environment.

**Notes**
- This README documents runtime flags only. For changes to default behavior edit `launch/uiabot_mini_gazebo_launch.py` in this package.
- If you want me to add examples for a specific SLAM or Nav2 configuration (e.g., `slam_toolbox`, `cartographer`, or Nav2 params), tell me which one and I can extend this README.
